# Homebrew formula for Agix AOS — `brew install agix-aos`.
#
# Agix AOS is the reborn stack: a Go core + the `agix-core` CLI, a TypeScript agent
# fleet run on Bun (never Node), and a Rust intra-agent bus. This formula installs the
# source tree (core/ + fleet/ + agents/ + the bus crate) into libexec, compiles the Go
# CLI (`agix-core`) and the Rust bus at install time, and exposes a thin `agix` wrapper
# on PATH. ZERO Node: no `node` dependency, no `.mjs`, no vendored `node_modules`.
#
# PUBLISH (operator-gated): the reborn public repo is born from an orphan-root of the
# Go/TS/Rust tree (see docs/reborn/REBORN-EXECUTION-SPEC.md). Point `url`/`homepage` at
# the real public release host, set `sha256` from the published reborn tarball, add a
# matching root LICENSE, then push this formula to the public tap
# (e.g. `brew tap agix-ai/agix && brew install agix-aos`).

  # Reborn Go/TS/Rust artifact (v0.1.0 — the fresh reborn baseline; matches the
  # `agix-core` binary constant in core/cmd/agix-core/main.go). Built from the staged
  # public tree by scripts/release/stage-reborn-public.sh.
  # OPERATOR: `url` assumes the release asset is attached to the `v0.1.0` tag of the
  # public repo agix-ai/agix-aos. If you host the tarball elsewhere (e.g. the
  # homebrew-agix tap release), update `url` to match. The `sha256` below is the hash of
  # dist/agix-aos-0.1.0.tar.gz — upload THAT exact file. If you rebuild the tarball,
  # recompute: `shasum -a 256 dist/agix-aos-0.1.0.tar.gz`. (The copy of this formula
  # that rides inside the tarball necessarily can't carry its own post-build hash — the
  # tap copy of this formula is what `brew` verifies against, and it is authoritative.)

    # Thin wrapper: `agix` execs the Go binary directly. NO Node.
    #
    # The wrapper MUST export AGIX_CORE_BIN and AGIX_FLEET_CLI. `agix-core agent run`
    # delegates to the Bun fleet runner, and the TS runtime resolves the Go engine back
    # as `AGIX_CORE_BIN ?? "agix-core" on PATH` (fleet/runtime/engine.ts, comb.ts). Only
    # the `agix` wrapper lands on PATH — `agix-core` itself lives in libexec — so without
    # these exports every governed engine spawn and every Comb read fails to resolve.
    # AGIX_FLEET_CLI is likewise required because the fleet runner is probed relative to
    # CWD, which for an installed user is their own project, not libexec.

      ★  Agix AOS v1 is in BETA — early and actively evolving. Expect rough edges and
         breaking changes between releases; feedback and issues are very welcome.

      Agix AOS runs autonomous AI agents that act on your machine — they can read
      and write files and run commands. Review agents before running them; agents
      marked "executor" have the most capability.

      • No API key? Agix uses your installed Claude Code / Codex CLI — so running
        agents makes real model calls that count against THAT account's usage.
      • Local-only: state lives in ~/.config/agix and ~/.local/state/agix. No telemetry.
      • Platform: macOS supported; Linux is beta (unverified end-to-end).

      Get started:  agix
      Uninstall:    brew uninstall agix-aos  &&  agix uninstall --purge-state

    # agree (CHANGELOG.md now leads with the reborn [0.1.0] entry). If you bump the
    # reborn version, bump the Go constant too so this assertion stays honest.
